```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Structures

1. What are the six types of atomic vectors? How does a list differ from an atomic vector?


2. What makes `is.vector()

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
