## Homework for next session:

Please email for the dataset if you do not have access to it.

1.	Press `ALT` + `F11` to see the available macros.

2.	Store the macro “consolidate_data” into a button and have the button somewhere on the tab “Task 1 Consolidate Macro” sheet. 
    a.	Go to developer tab and press “Insert” and then click “Button” to insert it, assigning it to the “consolidate_data” macro
    b.	When you press this button, the data from the second tab should be automatically populated into the first tab.

3.	Find the max and min of Column J in `“Task 2 Min and Max tab”` and store the values below the column

4.	Go to the “Task 3 Copy and Offset” tab. Create a macro that does the following:
    a.	Copies the formula from `D3` to `D1000`
    b.	Sums over these cells and displays the output right below the last cell
    c.	This should work if you copy to any length (no hard-coding except for references to `D3`)
